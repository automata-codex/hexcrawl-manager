      The Crown Prince has done the impossible: a road now traverses the
      once-impassable mountains at the western edge of the kingdom, opening a
      gateway to a mysterious and unexplored land. Known only as the
      &ldquo;western frontier,&rdquo; this vast and enigmatic wilderness is
      filled with towering trees, hidden glades, and shadowed depths. Rumors of
      ancient treasures and bizarre creatures spread quickly across the Known
      World, drawing the bold and the brave to answer the prince&rsquo;s call
      for adventurers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But be warned&mdash;the western frontier is no mere backwater. By day, it
      may seem like a land of promise, ripe for exploration and riches. By
      night, however, strange dangers stir beneath the boughs. While some who
      brave the darkness return with tales of terror, others are not so lucky.
      On occasion, adventurers disappear without a trace, or worse&mdash;they
      come back changed, haunted by something unseen, their minds never quite
      the same. Will you rise to the challenge and uncover the secrets of the
      forest? Or will the frontier claim you as one more lost soul? The call has
      gone out. The road is open. Will you step into the unknown?
