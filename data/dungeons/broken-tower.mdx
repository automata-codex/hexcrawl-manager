A ruined imperial watchtower, now the lair of Skargash's goblin warband. The upper floors collapsed
long ago, but the dungeons below remain intact. Skargash has made the underground great hall his
throne room, where he plots raids and dreams of conquest.

## Dungeon Overview

The tower rises from a rocky hilltop, its upper stories reduced to crumbling walls open to the sky.
A makeshift wooden palisade surrounds the base. The only intact entrance leads down stone stairs
into the dungeon level, which consists of five chambers connected by narrow corridors.

**Total dungeon area:** Approximately 3,000 square feet across one level.

## Room 1: Tower Entrance

**Dimensions:** 30 ft. × 20 ft., 15 ft. ceiling (open to sky above ruined walls)

Rubble-strewn entry hall with makeshift goblin fortifications. Overturned carts and sharpened
stakes create a defensive barrier. Arrow slits have been carved into the remaining walls.

**Features:**
- Stone stairs descend 10 ft. to the dungeon level
- Two goblin sentries watch from behind cover
- A crude alarm system (tin cans on string) alerts the dungeon below

**Encounter:** <a href={paths.goblinAmbush}>Goblin Ambush</a> triggers here if the party approaches openly.

## Room 2: Goblin Barracks

**Dimensions:** 40 ft. × 25 ft., 10 ft. ceiling

A foul-smelling chamber filled with crude bedding—piles of straw, stolen blankets, and animal
hides. Personal effects and stolen goods are scattered everywhere. A fire pit in the center
provides warmth and light, its smoke escaping through cracks in the ceiling.

**Features:**
- Sleeping space for 15-20 goblins
- Stolen goods from raided farmsteads scattered throughout
- A locked chest (DC 12 Thieves' Tools) under a pile of bedding

<TreasureTableMdx treasure={[treasure['stolen-goods']]} />

## Room 3: Prison Cells

**Dimensions:** 25 ft. × 15 ft., 8 ft. ceiling (three 8 ft. × 8 ft. cells along one wall)

Three iron-barred cells hold captured farmers awaiting Skargash's "ritual." The cells are old
imperial construction, repurposed by the goblins. A guard post with a stool and small table
sits opposite the cells.

**Features:**
- Three prisoners (farmers from Thornwick) can be rescued here
- Cell locks are old but functional (DC 14 Thieves' Tools, or keys on the guard)
- Prisoners know the layout of the dungeon and Skargash's daily routine

## Room 4: Defiled Shrine

**Dimensions:** 20 ft. × 20 ft., 12 ft. ceiling (domed)

An old imperial shrine, its original purpose now obscured by goblin fetishes and crude paintings.
The altar has been smashed and reassembled into a crude idol. Bones and offerings litter the floor.

**Features:**
- DC 14 Investigation to find the hidden symbol near the original altar
- DC 12 Religion reveals this was a shrine to an imperial god of protection

<TreasureTableMdx treasure={[treasure['silver-holy-symbol']]} />

## Room 5: Skargash's Throne Room

**Dimensions:** 50 ft. × 35 ft., 15 ft. ceiling (vaulted)

The underground great hall where Skargash holds court. A throne of bones and scavenged wood
dominates the far end. Torches line the walls, casting dancing shadows. Four pillars support
the vaulted ceiling.

**Features:**
- Skargash's bone throne on a raised stone platform
- Four goblin guards attend their warlord
- A locked iron chest (DC 15 Thieves' Tools) behind the throne holds the warband's wealth
- The Amulet of the Broken King glows at Skargash's throat

**Encounter:** <a href={paths.skargashThroneRoom}>Skargash's Throne Room</a>

## Secret Entrance (Optional)

The goblin dissenters know of a secret entrance through old sewage tunnels that emerge in
Room 3 (the prison cells). This passage is flooded knee-deep with stagnant water and requires
a DC 13 Constitution save to avoid being poisoned by the fumes. Grix can guide the party
through if they've earned the dissenters' trust.
