description: |
  Goblin scouts from the dissenter faction, wary but not immediately hostile.

  **Setup:** Two goblins step out of hiding, weapons raised but not attacking. One calls out in broken Common: "You not Skargash-friends? We talk, maybe."

  **Roleplaying the Scouts:** Nervous but hopeful. Will offer to lead friendly parties to Grix. Attack only if attacked first.

  **Developments:** If the party proves peaceful, the scouts lead them to the Hidden Hollow (0303) to meet Grix. This is the primary way to discover the dissenter camp.
