description: |
  A nest of giant spiders in web-choked trees.

  **Setup:** Thick webs fill the canopy. Two giant spiders lurk above, waiting for prey to stumble into their domain.

  **Tactics:** Drop from above for surprise. Use webs to restrain prey. Retreat to treetops if badly wounded.

  **Treasure:** Webbed corpse of a goblin scout (2d6 sp, crude map). Webbed bundle containing a potion of healing.

  **Developments:** The dead goblin was from Skargash's warband. The map shows patrol routes and marks the Broken Tower as "home."
