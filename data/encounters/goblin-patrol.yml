description: |
  A small group of goblin scouts watching for intruders and potential raid targets.

  **Setup:** Three goblins moving through the area, checking game trails and watching for travelers. They're not looking for a fight but will attack if they spot easy prey.

  **Tactics:** One goblin hangs back to flee and warn the warband if things go badly. They prefer ambush and will disengage if outmatched. Can be bribed with food or shiny objects.

  **Treasure:** 2d6 silver pieces per goblin. One carries a crude map showing patrol routes (leads to Broken Tower).

  **Developments:** If captured, goblins will reveal the tower's location to save themselves. They're terrified of Skargash.
