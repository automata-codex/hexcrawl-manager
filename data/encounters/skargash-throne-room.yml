  The final confrontation with Warlord Skargash.

  **Setup:** Skargash sits on a throne of bones in the tower's underground great hall. Four goblin guards attend him. The Amulet of the Broken King glows at his throat.

  **Tactics:** Skargash fights to the death, convinced of his invincibility. Guards protect their leader but flee if he falls. The amulet grants Skargash advantage on Charisma checks vs. goblins.

  **The Amulet:** If the amulet is removed or destroyed during combat, all goblin guards immediately flee, Skargash loses his bonus action attacks, and his confidence shatters—he may try to bargain.

  **Developments:** With Skargash dead and the amulet taken, his warband scatters. The goblin threat to Thornwick ends—at least for now.
