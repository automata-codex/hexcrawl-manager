description: |
  A hungry pack of wolves hunting in the forest.

  **Setup:** Three wolves, desperate with hunger, have been driven from their normal territory by the increased goblin activity.

  **Tactics:** Circle prey, looking for the weakest target. Flee if two wolves are killed. Can be driven off with fire or loud noises.

  **Treasure:** Wolf pelts (5gp each if properly skinned).

  **Developments:** A ranger or druid might calm the wolves or learn they've been displaced. Following their trail leads toward the Broken Tower.
