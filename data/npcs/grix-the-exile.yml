description: |
  A scarred goblin with intelligent eyes and a cautious demeanor. Grix was Skargash's second-in-command until they refused to burn a farmstead with children inside. Now they lead the exiles and seek allies against their former warlord.
notes:
  - Knows Skargash's weakness is the Amulet of the Broken King; without it, he loses the loyalty of his sorcerers
  - Once saved Skargash's life, a debt Skargash resents
  - Some of their followers want revenge while others just want to flee
