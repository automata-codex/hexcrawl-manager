  A massive goblin covered in ritual scars, wearing a glowing amulet around his neck. Skargash is cruel, cunning, and utterly convinced of his own destiny to rule. He found the Amulet of the Broken King in the tower ruins and believes it marks him as chosen.
notes:
  - His power comes from the Amulet of the Broken King, which grants him limited charm over other goblins
  - Destroying or stealing the amulet would shatter his warband's loyalty
  - Fights to the death, convinced of his invincibility
