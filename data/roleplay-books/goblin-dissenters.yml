name: Goblin Dissenters
keyword: goblin
culturalOverview: |
  The dissenters are refugees from Skargash's brutal rule. They cling to older goblin traditions
  that valued cunning and survival over cruelty. Under Grix's leadership, they dream of a life
  without constant warfare.

  Unlike Skargash's warband, the dissenters remember a time before the Amulet of the Broken King,
  when goblin leaders earned loyalty through cleverness rather than fear. They're suspicious of
  outsiders but desperate enough to consider unlikely alliances.

rpVoiceNotes:
  - Speak quickly, nervously, always watching for threats
  - Mix Common and Goblin, especially when emotional
  - Self-deprecating humor as a defense mechanism
  - Surprisingly philosophical about fate and survival

loreHooks:
  - The dissenters know secret ways into the Broken Tower
  - Grix once saved Skargash's life—a debt Skargash resents
  - Some dissenters want revenge; others just want to flee far away

sampleDialogue:
  - "Skargash is strong, yes, but strong is not same as smart. We are smart."
  - "You kill Skargash, we help. We know secret way in. But you must promise—no kill all goblins. Just bad ones."
  - "The amulet makes him think he is god. Take amulet, he is just goblin with big mouth."

  instructions: |
    Roll d4 when the party interacts with goblin dissenters and asks for information.
    Grix or other dissenters share what they know about Skargash and his operations.
    The dissenters are helpful but cautious—they won't share everything until trust is earned.

      report: Tower Defenses
      sampleDialogue: |
        There is secret entrance, yes. Old sewers, from before. Skargash does not know—
        too proud to crawl in filth like smart goblin. We show you, but is dangerous.
        Bad air, bad water. You must be quiet, quiet, quiet.
      relevantConditions: |
        The dissenters know of a secret entrance through the old sewers. This bypasses
        the main entrance where the goblin-ambush encounter triggers. Useful for
        stealth approaches or rescuing prisoners.

      report: Skargash's Weakness
      sampleDialogue: |
        The amulet is everything. Without it, the sorcerers will not follow. They
        think it makes him chosen by old gods. Ha! Is just shiny rock with magic.
        Take amulet, Skargash is nothing. Warband falls apart like wet leaves.
      relevantConditions: |
        The Amulet of the Broken King is the source of Skargash's power. Removing
        or destroying it during combat causes the goblin guards to flee and breaks
        Skargash's confidence.

      report: Patrol Schedules
      sampleDialogue: |
        Patrols change at dawn and dusk—that is when tower is most weak. Guards
        tired, sleepy, thinking about food. In between? Many eyes watching. But
        at dawn, at dusk? Only few. That is when we move, when we hunt. Smart way.
      relevantConditions: |
        Tactical information about when the tower's defenses are weakest. Dawn and
        dusk approaches give advantage on stealth checks. Also reveals the patrol
        patterns described in the goblin-patrol encounter.

      report: The Prisoners
      sampleDialogue: |
        Skargash keeps prisoners in old cells. Three farmers from village—still
        alive, we think. He plans something bad. Ritual, maybe. Sacrifice to old
        gods? We do not know. But is soon. Days, not weeks. You must hurry.
      relevantConditions: |
        Three captured farmers are held in the prison cells (Room 3 of the dungeon).
        Skargash plans to sacrifice them soon. Creates urgency for the party to act.
