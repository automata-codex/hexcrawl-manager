# Trails and Travel

## Mark a Trail (Player-Facing Rule)

*Time: 3 hours (6 in difficult terrain)*

You can blaze a trail between two hexes, making it easier to follow later.

* **Using Trails**

  * Following a trail means you won’t get lost.
  * Once a trail becomes **Permanent**, travel along it is faster and always reliable.

* **Trail Longevity**

  * A new trail always lasts until the end of the season.
  * Trails near a haven are kept up during downtime and may become permanent with consistent upkeep.
  * Trails in the wilderness may fade between seasons unless they’re used regularly.

* **Permanent Trails**

  * Trails that see steady use (or regular maintenance near a haven) over time become **Permanent**.
  * Permanent trails never fade.

**Marking Trails**

* When the party takes the *Mark a Trail* action, record the hex-to-hex segment.
* A trail always lasts until the end of the current season.

**Seasonal Upkeep (at season change)**
For each trail segment:

1. **Near a Haven (within 3 hexes):**

  * Trail is automatically maintained.
  * If it survives **3 consecutive seasons**, it becomes **Permanent**.
2. **Far from a Haven:**

  * Roll 1d6: on 1–3 the trail is lost; on 4–6 it persists.
  * If the trail was **used this season**, increment its streak. Otherwise, reset the streak to 0.
  * If the streak reaches 3, the trail becomes **Permanent**.

**Permanent Trails**

* Never require upkeep or rolls again.
* Always easy to follow.
* Travel time is reduced by 50%.

**Bookkeeping**
Each trail segment needs only:

* `permanent` (yes/no)
* `streak` (0–3)
* `usedThisSeason` (true/false)

# Trails and Travel

*Time to mark: 3 hours (6 in difficult terrain)*

Adventurers can blaze trails between hexes, leaving markers and signs that make future travel easier. Trails evolve over time based on how often they are used and whether they are maintained.

## Using Trails

* Traveling along a trail prevents the party from getting lost.
* Once a trail becomes **Permanent**, travel along it is faster (reduce travel time by 50%) and always reliable.

## Trail Longevity

* A newly marked trail always lasts until the end of the current season.
* At the change of season, each trail must be checked to see whether it survives:

  * **Near a haven (within 3 hexes):** Trails are automatically maintained. If they endure for 3 consecutive seasons, they become permanent.
  * **Far from havens:** Roll 1d6. On 1–3 the trail is lost; on 4–6 it persists. If the trail was used this season, it gains progress toward permanence. If it was unused, its progress resets.

## Permanent Trails

* A trail that has been used (or maintained near a haven) for **3 consecutive seasons** becomes **Permanent**.
* Permanent trails never fade, require no upkeep, and always provide their benefits.

## Bookkeeping

Each trail segment needs only a few pieces of information:

* **Permanent** (yes/no)
* **Streak** (0–3 consecutive seasons of use/maintenance)
* **Used this Season** (true/false, reset at season change)

  * **Far from havens:** Roll 1d6. On 1–3 the trail is lost; on 4–6 it persists. If the trail was used this season, it gains progress toward permanence. If it was unused, its progress resets.
  * **Randomness:** Always keep the actual d6 result (like weather rolls) in the log. Do not replace with seeded values.

## Permanent Trails

* A trail that has been used (or maintained near a haven) for **3 consecutive seasons** becomes **Permanent**.
* Permanent trails never fade, require no upkeep, and always provide their benefits.

## Season Rollovers and Mid-Session Play

* In play, you don’t need to pause a session when the calendar ticks over into a new season. Finish the session normally.
* When applying session logs, run the **season rollover** step before processing any events that occur in the new season.
* If a paradox arises (a trail is logged as used after it decayed), the use trumps the decay. Interpret this as the party having re-marked or rediscovered the trail. The streak resets appropriately, but the trail survives for that session.
* Rollover results (including d6 rolls) are stored in the log so the same random outcomes can’t be regenerated later.

## Bookkeeping

Each trail segment needs only a few pieces of information:

* **Permanent** (yes/no)
* **Streak** (0–3 consecutive seasons of use/maintenance)
* **Used this Season** (true/false, reset at season change)
* **Footprints** (audit log: creation, use, survival rolls, deletion)

Additional rules:

* Deleted trails are hard-removed from the active map but remain recorded in footprints.
* Havens should be listed in the campaign data file so their distance to trails can be checked automatically.
* Season IDs are case-insensitive.
