# Rules Drift Log

**Purpose:** Quick notes when code diverges from written rules. Not a formal tracking system—just breadcrumbs for future-you.

**Usage:** If you can't update the rules *right now*, drop a one-liner here. Review during weekly release prep or when the list gets annoyingly long.

**Location:** Keep this at docs root so it's visible and nags you gently.
