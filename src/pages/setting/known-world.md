The Known World is just that, the part of the world that we know. There are undoubtedly other parts of the world, but we have no way to reach them, no contact with them, and no trade. The Known World is bounded in the west by the Skyreach Mountains, in the north by the frozen steppe of Tal Kheer, and in the west by the Aeluin Vale and the Zalkhuutai Desert. The Dolgion Sea forms the southern edge of the subcontinent. The Known World is centered around the lush Gol River Valley. It also includes the Vaulridge Plains and the Riviera.

## Aleuin Vale

The Aleuin Vale is home to the wood elves.

## Dolgion Sea

The Dolgion Sea is a large body of water. 

## Gol River Valley

The Gol River runs from Tal Kheer in the north to the Dolgion Sea in the south. The Gol River Valley is the most fertile region in the Known World and the center of culture and civilization.

## Riviera

The Riveria is the coastal region between the Gol River Valley and the Skyreach Mountains. It is home to humans and spindrift dwarves.

## Skyreach Mountains

The Skyreach Mountains form an impassable barrier between the Known World and the unknown lands to the west, known as the western frontier or "Baruun Khil" in the old tongue of the giants.

## Tal Kheer

Tal Kheer is the frozen steppe to the north of the Gol River Valley.

## Vaulridge Plains

The Plains of Vaulridge are an arid grassland between the fertile Gol River Valley and the imposing Skyreach Mountains.

## Zalkhuutai Desert

The Zalkhuutai Desert is a vast wasteland to the east of the Gol River Valley. It is home to the nomadic elves known as dunewalkers.
